# Contours
Contour detection_Computer Vision
Contours are lines joining all the continuous objects or points (along the boundary), having the same color or intensity. For example, it detects the shape of a leaf based on its parameters or border. Contours are an important tool for shape and object detection. The contours of an object are the boundary lines that make up the shape of an object as it is. Contours are also called outline, edges, or structure, for a very good reason: theyâ€™re a way to mark changes in depth.
